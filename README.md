# Venture funding with deep learning

This repository contains the code for a Jupyter notebook which create a binary classification model using a deep neural network. That consists of three technical deliverables to 1) Preprocess data for a neural network model. 2) Use the model-fit-predict pattern to compile and evaluate a binary classification model. 3) Optimize the model.

## Technologies

The application is written in Python 3.9.7 and uses the following libraries:

* numpy - 1.20.3
* pandas - 1.3.4
* sklearn -1.0.2
* tensorflow - 2.8.0 
* matplotlib - 3.4.3


The application runs from the command line on Windows, Linux or Mac OS systems, or from the Anaconda Navigator Software.

## Installation Guide
Download the repository code through GitHub and unpack the archive. Run the following commands to install all the dependencies:

pip install tensorflow

PLease refer to Jupyter Notebook installation guide: https://jupyter.org/install.

## Usage
In the command line go to the folder containing the jupyter notebook. Run `jupyter notebook` to start the jupyter notebook. Alternatively, open Anaconda Navigator, click on "Launch Jupyter Notebook" to start the jupyter notebook.
